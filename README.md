C# bindings for the [GNU Multiple Precision](https://gmplib.org) (GMP) arithmetic library.

#### Note

- Not all GMP functions are currently bound â€” only a few are used by the Nethermind. If you need a specific function, please open an issue.
- To build the GMP, an unofficial GMP repository mirror is used, as access to the original one is inaccessible from GitHub.
