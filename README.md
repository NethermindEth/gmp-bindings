C# bindings for the [GNU Multiple Precision](https://gmplib.org) (GMP) arithmetic library.

#### Note

- Not all GMP functions are currently bound â€” only a subset of integer functions. If you need a specific function, please open an issue.
- To build the GMP, an unofficial GMP repository mirror is used, as the official repository is inaccessible from GitHub.
